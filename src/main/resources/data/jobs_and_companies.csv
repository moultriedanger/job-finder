A couple tips to share for the exam and Statement of Qualifications:- The Statement of Qualifications are like interview questions that you answer in writing. We do recommend using word.doc for your responses and keep to the requirements if it says two pages for example and the specific font of Arial 12 font. Take your time to think about your response in answering the questions. Also check spelling. Please do look at the duty statement from the job posting and match to your experience to answer the questions.- For the ‘exam,’ the exams are questions around your experience. Include all your experience from every job to volunteer work, internships, leading groups and/or projects, and more. Don’t sell yourself short. Before you start the exam, review the sample questions in the exam bulletin. This gives you a sense of what we’ll ask you. Have your resume handy. You’ll need it during the exam. Make sure your resume shows you meet the minimum qualifications. Anything you mention in your exam needs to be on your resume.",8398.0,MONTHLY,Greater Sacramento,Mid-Senior level,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3884430592/?trk=jobs_biz_prem_srch,12908540.0,California Department of Human Resources (CalHR),"The California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) was created on July 1, 2012, by Governor Brown's Reorganization Plan Number 1 of 2011.
